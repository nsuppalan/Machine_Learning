    " ### Multiplication Rule\n",
    " Imagine you are doing a compound experiment consisting of **r** random experiment such that $k^{th}$ experiment has $n_k $ possible outcomess for $k = 1, 2, 3..,r $ Then there are a total of $n_1 \\times n_2 \\times n_3 \\times ... \\times n_r $ possible outcomes for the sequence of **r** experiments.\n",
    "\t\t\n",
    "Possible number of outcomes for a set with __n__ elements?: $2^n$ including the empty set $\\emptyset$ and the set itself. This follows by multiplication since for each element we can choose whether to include it or exclude it.  For instance set {1, 2, 3} has 8 subsets $\\emptyset$, {1}, {2}. {3}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}, {1, 2, 3}.\n",

In this case, for first position we will have *n* options. For second position we will have *(n-1)* options since one applicant is already chosen for the first position. For the third position we will have *(n-2)* options, and then for $\\textit{k}^{th}$ position we will have *(n-k+1)* options. Thus when ordering matters and repetition is not allowed, the total number of ways to choose *k* elements from a set of *n* elements is:\n",

    "#### Birthday Paradox\n",
    "**Problem**:If there are *k* people in a party, what is the probability that at least two of them has the same birthday? We can assume that there are 365 days in a year, and all days are equally like to be the birthday of a specific person.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**: As we have learned both **Ordered Sampling with replacement** and **Ordered Sampling without replacement** just now, let's see which one will be used here.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can probably solve this problem more easily by thinking in complementary way, instead of matching every pair of people , let's find what is the probability **P(A)**  such that no two people in the room share the birthday, our required probability will just be complement of this i.e. **1 - P(A)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "So in essence, we need to choose *k* samples from 365, such that they are ordered and without repetition. This will be count of how many ways such an event A can occur. Now, what will be the count of our sample space. Each person can be born on any of the 365 days. Thus each person in the party has 365 options.  This is case of ordered sampling with repetition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus,\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is called paradox, because people often think that probability of two people in a room sharing birthday might be low, but for just 23 people, (i.e *k* = 23) probability of such event happening is 0.5073, while for *k* = 57, It crosses 0.99. In another words, there is 99% chance that two people will share birthdays in a party of 57 people.\n",

    "- {1, 2}\n",

This is called a case of *n choose k* and represented as $n \\choose k $. Now contrast this with case where we wanted to choose *k* applicants from a pool of *n*. There order mattered (You can't give a job of accountant to programmer). In fact, for any *k* elements subset, of a set of n elements, we can order elements in k! ways. thus we can say\n",

    "#### Multiplication rule with accounting for overcounting\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also see the above case in another perspective. First we calculate the counts through multiplication rule and then adjust the count when we have overcounted i.e. say if we counted twice, we divide the count by the factor of 2. Suppose you are choosing to form a committee of 2 people from a group of 4. In this case, we can use multiplication rule to say that for first position on committee we have 4 options, and for second position we have 3 options. However committee (A,B) will be same as (B, A), so we have overcounted by a factor of 2. Therefore the number of possibilities will be $$ \\frac{(4 \\times 3)}{2} = 6$$\n",

We have set of _n_ elements (e.g. A = {1, 2, 3... n}), and we want to draw __k__ samples from the set such that ordering doesn't matter and repetition is allowed. For a case when A = {1, 2, 3} and k=2, we have 6 options:\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's say you have 3 options for a icecream flavor - Vanilla (V), Chocolate (C) and Strawberry (S). You can choose 2 scoops. Person A may like strawberry a lot, so she may go with 2 scoops of chocolate (and thus any other flavor). If I choose vanilla and strawberry, it would be same as choosing strawberry and vanilla. Therefore, order doesn't matter and replacement is allowed. As we just saw above, there will be 6 total options of creating a unique ice cream.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can better intution to this problem by solving an isomorphic problem (same problem in different view). Let us find number of ways to put __k__  indistinguishable particles into __n__ distinguishable boxes. For __k__ we say it is indistinguisable because swapping them any way is not considered as separate possibility. (Remember {V, C} = {C, V}).\n",

    "Hence we have 2 | and 2 $\\bullet$ in between. Therefore, there are __(n-1+k)__ slots between these two outer walls. Out of these __(n+k-1)__ slots, we need to put __k__ particles. Therefore, it is \"__(n+k-1)__ choose __k__\" or ${n+k-1 \\choose k} $\n",

    "This is actually known as *Bose-Einstein* value. To relate this back to the original question of choosing __k__ objects from set of __n__ objects such that order doesn't matter and objects can be replaced , we can let each box correspond to one of the n objects and use the particles as \"check marks\" to tally how many times each object is selected. For example, if a certain box contains exactly 3 particles, that means the object corresponding to that box was chosen exactly 3 times. The particles being indistinguishable corresponds to the fact that we don’t care about the order in which the objects are chosen. Thus, the answer to the original question is also ${n+k-1 \\choose k} $\n",
